- **Rich Content Support:** Support for various content types, including text, images, videos, and interactive elements for engaging learning experiences.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitor and track student progress through detailed analytics and reporting features.
- **Responsive Design:** A responsive and intuitive user interface that adapts to various devices, providing a consistent experience across desktop and mobile platforms.
## Tech Stack

- **Client(Front-End):** React, Redux, TailwindCSS

- **Server(Back-End):** Node, Express

- **Database:** MongoDB

- **Real-time Communication:** Socket.io

- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)


## Front-End
The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, which are critical for providing an engaging learning experience to the students. The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls

There are two distinct profiles within StudyNotion â€“ one for students and another for instructors, each offering a unique set of functionalities.

***Some of these functionalities include:***

**1. For Students:**
- **Homepage:** This page will have a brief introduction to the platform, as well as links to the course list and user details.
- **Course List:** This page will have a list of all the courses available on the platform, along with their descriptions and ratings.
- **Wishlist:** This page will display all the courses that a student has added to their wishlist.
- **Cart Checkout:** This page will allow the user to complete the course purchase.
- **Course Content:** This page will have the course content for a particular course, including videos, and other related material.
- **User Details:** This page will have details about the student's account, including their name, email, and other relevant information.
- **User Edit Details:** This page will allow the student to edit their account details.

**2. For Instructors:**
- **Dashboard:** This page will have an overview of the instructor's courses, as well as the ratings and feedback for each course.
- **Insights:** This page will have detailed insights into the instructor's courses, including the number of views, clicks, and other relevant metrics.
- **Course Management Pages:** These pages will allow the instructor to create, update, and delete courses, as well as manage the course content and pricing.
- **View and Edit Profile Details:** These pages will allow the instructor to view and edit their account details. 
- **Insights:** This page will have detailed insights into the platform's metrics, including the number of registered users, courses, and revenue.
- **Instructor Management:** This page will allow the admin to manage the platform's instructors, including their account details, courses, and ratings.
- **Other Relevant Pages:** The admin will also have access to other relevant pages, such as user management and course management pages.

## Back-End
The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, The back end provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as user authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back end also handles the logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.

Features and Functionalities of the Back-end: The back end of StudyNotion provides a range of features and functionalities, including:

- **User authentication and authorization:** Students and instructors can sign up and log in to the platform using their email addresses and password. The platform also supports OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality for added security.
- **Course management:** Instructors can create, read, update, and delete courses, as well as manage course content and media. Students can view and rate courses.
- **Payment Integration:** Students will purchase and enroll on courses by completing the checkout flow that is followed by Razorpay integration for payment handling.
- **Cloud-based media management:** StudyNotion uses Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service, to store and manage all media content, including images, videos, and documents.
- **Markdown formatting:** Course content in document format is stored in Markdown format, which allows for easier display and rendering on the front end.
